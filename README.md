# NextStep AR
## Team Edulon

### This project is for Lifelines '25 Hackathon.
### Problem Statement:  Education Access for Displaced Children


Currently, this is simply a foundation with simple raycasting in markerless AR, soon to be turned into an immersive Augmented Reality CPR tutorial, and we also aim to soon have the following features be implemented:
1. Geographical-Based Skills: provides specific survival guides based on GPS location data. E.g. users in Japan receive tsunami evacuation tips, users in Gaza receive bomb evacuation tips.
2. AR Tutorials: used to demonstrate survival skills such as CPR, fire-making, and earthquake-safe positioning. These demonstrations enhance visual learning by simulating real-world scenarios.
3. Customization and Accessibility: The app includes features for different demographics, making it accessible to children, elderly individuals, and people with disabilities.

The files have been placed in a google drive link found in link.txt as it surpassed the maximum on github.
